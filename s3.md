#### S3 (Storage)
1. Use cases: Backup and recovery, storage, big data, cloud 
2. Fundamentals
    - Bucket: object container, object always have a bucket
      - no Windows Explorer like hierarchy 
      - choose region that's close to you so that it's cheap
      - object will have a generated unique link
    - Objects && Metadata
      - S3 can't see metadata and data(content) of objects
      - Objects only resides in one region unless you transfer it to another region
      - Buckets can be accessed in any region even you choose a specific one in initialization 
    - Read after Write Eventually consistent: different users performs on most updated version of objects

3. Storage
   - Object Storage (S3): no hierarchy, cannot extend storage, use for video/archive/images
   - Block Storage (EBS): higher I/O performance
4. Practice:
   - Bucket naming conventions: BucketRestrictions.html
   - Buckets are private in default 
5. Versioning: Multiple versions of objects in one bucket
   - Use cases: Restore accidentally deletion, overwrite 
   - Bucket is un-versioned by default, you cannot go back to this state once change it to enabled, but you can do suspend
   - Rules: enable versioning != making objects public; all objects in one bucket will share one version ID
   - Full Deletion: use version ID
   - Objects before setting versioning will have null version ID
   - Version-Suspend: change future request only![versioning suspend.png](img%2Fversioning%20suspend.png)
   - MFA Delete: Enforce security credentials 
6. Encryption: protect in-transit and at-rest data
   - Types: 
     - Server side encryption: done by S3, AES-256
       - 3 options: SSE-S3, SSE-KMS (flexible), SSE-C (S3 won't store key)
     - Client side encryption: 
       - 2 options: 
         - use master key managed by KMS![cse1.png](img%2Fcse1.png)
         - use client side master key![cse2.png](img%2Fcse2.png)
7. Tags, Transfer Acceleration, Multipart upload (for large files)
    - Tag: not only in S3, key-value pairs to manage/search/filter resources
      - use cases: cost allocation by tags (AWS Cost Explorer, automation filtering (dev/prod), IAM access control)
      - tag set can contain at most 10 tags for one bucket
    - Transfer Acceleration: long distance transfer speed up
    - Multipart upload: large objects in parts, use when >= 100MB, 3 steps, cpuoverview.html

8. Events: notification through SNS, SQS queue or AWS Lambda code![events.png](img%2Fevents.png)
   - SNS: set same region with your bucket, create topic -> create subscription, set events in S3 properties
